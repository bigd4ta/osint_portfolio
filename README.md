This portfolio houses software projects I've implemented over the past couple of months. It's a non-exhaustive list, and some of the projects are precursors to versions I subsequently implemented at work for use by professional intelligence analysts.

All projects are implemented in Python, and they involve:
- Web servers/HTML
- Multithreading
- Web scraping
- Web crawling
- APIs/authentication
- Scripting/business process automation
